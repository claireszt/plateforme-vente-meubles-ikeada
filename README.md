## Introduction
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the creation of a management platform named "IkeAda", the brainchild of Lauréline Fleury specializing in the sale of second-hand furniture. The project aims to create an interactive website allowing users to browse and purchase furniture, as well as enabling the administrator to add, manage, and delete products.

## Technologies Used
The project is developed using the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en): Runtime environment for the server side.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Web framework for Node.js, facilitating API creation.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): CSS framework for rapid development and styling.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/): Database management system, based on Postgres.

## Objectives
The main objective is to create a web platform where users can browse, buy, and propose furniture for sale. Key features include:

1. Display of furniture for sale on the main page.
2. Details of each piece of furniture including photo, type, price, dimensions, colors, and materials.
3. Administration page with login, product management, modification, and deletion.
4. Creation of user accounts to customize display according to preferences.
5. Proposal of furniture for sale by logged-in users (to be validated by the administrator).

## Constraints and Concepts Covered
The project must be completed within two weeks, using Bootstrap for styling. Covered concepts include web deployment, databases, front-end/back-end interactions, use of a framework for the back-end, and password security.
